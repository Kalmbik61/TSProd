# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Created small App for client 

Created **React** app with TypeScript and subscribe letter/support form using TS configurate.

In this project I was used: 

- **stylelint** extension for style a my .scss/css files
- small own **library** for this project with enums, interfaces and types
- **classname** library for dynamic response for any changes 
- **axios** for requests
- **yup** and **react-form-hook** for HTML forms
